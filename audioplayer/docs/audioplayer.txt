   :depth: 3


A Django application for integrating a Flash based mp3 audioplayer into
templates using a custom template tag. It uses the flashplayer from
1pixelout_  and can be easily customized by template parameters.

Installation
============
To install the audioplayer app, follow these steps:

1. Unpack the downloaded tarball in your projects directory
2. Add myproject.audioplayer`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` variable
3. Configure your webserver or ``urls.py`` to serve the Flash file
   ``player.swf`` found in the ``media/audioplayer`` subdirectory. By
   default the player is searched at
   ``{{ MEDIA_URL }}/audioplayer/player.swf`` but that can be changed
   (see below).

That's it. The audioplayer does not use any models or views, only a custom
template tag named ``audioplayer``.  

Using the audioplayer template tag
==================================
The audioplayer can be used in any template like this::

    {% load audioplayer %}
    # ...
    {% audioplayer file=file_url %}
    # ...

First load the audioplayer template tag library, then instantiate the player
as often as you like, using different files and/or player configurations.

Here's a live example:

Customizing the audioplayer
===========================
The audioplayer can be customized to fit your project's needs.You can set
looping, width, height and the colors for the various player areas like
this::

    {% audioplayer file=file_url,loop=True,autostart=True,bg=0xff000 %}

The following table contains the full list of supported parameters. The
original can be found at 1pixelout_runtime_. Please be aware that the
original values for the ``autostart`` and ``loop`` has been *pythonified*:
Instead of using ``yes`` and ``no`` the ``audioplayer`` tag can also use
``False`` and ``True``.

============== ========== ===================================================

Serving the Flash player
========================
By default the audioplayer tag uses the player.swf found at 
``{{ MEDIA_URL }}/audioplayer/player.swf``.

To change that behaviour pass the URL of the player using the ``playerUrl``
parameter like this::

    {% audioplayer file=file.mp3,playerUrl=/foo/bar/player.swf,loop=True %}
    

Inserted code
=============
The following code is inserted by the ``audioplayer`` template tag based on the
``audioplayer/audioplayer.html`` template (the shown code is just an example and
varies depending on your parameters)::

    <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/media/audioplayer/player.swf" width="156" height="18" class="audioplayer">
        <param name="movie" value="/media/audioplayer/player.swf" />
        <param name="FlashVars" value="height=18&#38;bg=0xff000&#38;slider=0xB29461&#38;track=0xFFFFFF&#38;righticon=0x666666&#38;lefticon=0x666666&#38;soundFile=%2Fmedia%2Faudio%2FSucker_Kings_-_Cab_Driver.mp3&#38;loader=0xEEFFCC&#38;rightbg=0xCCCCCC&#38;bgcolor=0xFFFFFF&#38;rightbghover=0xAAAAAA&#38;autostart=no&#38;text=0x4F4F4F&#38;leftbg=0xEFEFEF&#38;righticonhover=0x444444&#38;border=0x00FF00&#38;width=156&#38;loop=yes" />
        <param name="quality" value="high" />
        <param name="menu" value="false" />
        <param name="wmode" value="transparent" />
        <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />
    </object>

Replacing the default code template
-----------------------------------
The code shown above is read from the template ``audioplayer/audioplayer.html``.
You can provide a custom template to adopt the code to your needs. The
template will be passed the following context variables:

player_url
    The URL of the audioplayer.
width
    The width of the player.
height
    The height of the player.
bgcolor
    The background color of the player.
flash_vars
    The flashvars for the player.

Flash vars format
-----------------
Internally the flash vars are encoded using the ``urlencode`` function from
the ``urllib``. Here's an example of some flash vars after the encoding::
    
    height=18&bg=0xff000&slider=0xB29461&track=0xFFFFFF&righticon=0x666666

Unfortunately the ampersand "&" is not allowed in XHTML documents and needs to
be encoded. Rather to encode it using the entity representation ``&amp;`` the
unicode representation ``&38;`` is used, so the encoded flash vars look like
this::

    height=18&#38;bg=0xff000&#38;slider=0xB29461&#38;track=0xFFFFFF&#38;righticon=0x666666

Autoescape considerations
-------------------------
In order to play nicely with the new `autoescape feature`_ in the Django
development version you need version ``>=0.2.2`` of the audioplayer app.

Up from this version the template tag marks the inserted code as safe and
correctly respects the current autoescape value in the template context, which
needs to be considered when you provide a custom
``audioplayer/audioplayer.html`` template.

Alternatives
============

JavaScript
----------
Instead of integrating the audioplayer using a template tag one could also use
some JavaScript to add the player to the page. The easiest way to achieve this
is to use the jQuery_ and the jQuery plugin jMP3_.

Other Flash players
-------------------
Besides the nice player from 1pixelout_, there are several other Flash based
audioplayers out on the web. Here's a list of them:
